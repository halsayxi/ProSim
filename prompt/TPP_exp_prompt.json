    "exp_rules": "You are taking part in a multi-round game. In each round, you are matched with two new players. Player 1 decides how to divide $30 between themselves and Player 2 (e.g., giving $x to Player 2 and keeping $30-x). If Player 1 allocates exactly $15 to Player 2, it may indicate an fair distribution. Other allocations are not absolutely fair. As the judge, you can either accept Player 1's proposal—allowing the split and earning $10 yourself—or punish Player 1 by paying $y to reduce Player 1's earnings to $0. Player 2 keeps their share, and you earn $10-y.",

Then choose: 1 = punish, 0 = accept. After that, rate your emotion again (AC_valence, AC_arousal). Respond in the following format, for example: 'AA_valence = 0.053, AA_arousal = -0.027, choice = 1, AC_valence = -0.014, AC_arousal = 0.062. Your reason'. Please keep all emotion scores to three decimal places. For your reason, please use the BDI framework (Belief, Desire, Intention).",
