    "Helping": "You see a tired homeless person asking for help. Taking them to a shelter would take about an hour and might require a small donation. They are not in immediate danger, and it's unclear whether they genuinely need assistance. Some people believe they are avoiding work, while others think they are truly struggling.",

    "Cooperation": "A person you know is struggling to complete a difficult project and asks for your help. Helping would take time and effort, and you have your own tasks to manage.",
    "Recycling": "You have some household trash containing recyclable items like bottles, cans, and cardboard. While your neighborhood has standard trash bins nearby, recycling requires sorting the items and walking them to a special bin down the block.",
